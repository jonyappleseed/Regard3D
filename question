I've downloaded the latest update but have noticed that the option to use GPS information to initialize triangulation is greyed out. How can I enable it? My project partner and I have control points that we took from our waypoints using a Brunton compass and a rangefinder; we'd like to know how to incorporate them into the model using your software. Thank you for your time.
